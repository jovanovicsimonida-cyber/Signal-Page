🔁 SIGNAL Framework for Lifecycle Email Strategy

Lifecycle Equivalent
What I Do
S — Segment
Lifecycle Mapping & Cohort Definition
Map users by journey stage and behavior — trial, onboarding, active, dormant, churned. Create behavior-based cohorts such as “activated but unpaid” or “at-risk high spenders.”
I — Interpret
Behavioral Signal Analysis
Examine product usage, engagement, and CRM data to surface friction points or churn risks. Identify what behaviors signal success vs. stagnation.
G — Generate
Flow Architecture & System Design
Architect the flow logic before writing: define triggers, entry/exit conditions, and the conversion path for one key journey (onboarding, activation, upsell, reactivation).
N — Nurture
Storyline & Relationship Building
Write the sequence itself and shape the emotional narrative. Establish tone, cadence, and continuity through ongoing campaigns that educate, celebrate, and deepen connection.
A — Automate
Trigger Integration & ESP Setup
Connect behavioral events to automation rules so messages fire at the right moment across email, in-app, and CRM. Ensure data sync and deliverability hygiene.
L — Learn
Performance & Retention Optimization
Track activation, retention, and expansion metrics. Review results, test hypotheses, and feed insights back into segmentation and copy for continuous lift.


Main offer: Trial-to-Paid Flow Build + Reverb
The SIGNAL Flow is designed for SaaS and product-led companies that want to convert more users in their trial period (7-14-30- days) without relying on guesswork or static sequences.
SIGNAL installs a feedback-driven logic that constantly responds to what users do (and don’t do).
Every flow comes with REVERB, an adaptive layer that detects drop-offs and re-engages them automatically - so your system never goes silent when users do.
What you delive:
One core Trial-to-Paid sequence: onboarding + activation + upgrade push
3–5 Reverb micro-cycles: each tied to a missed action or drop-off point
Trigger map + timing rules: what fires, when, and what gets suppressed
Measurement plan: what “worked” means and how you’ll improve it in the retainer
