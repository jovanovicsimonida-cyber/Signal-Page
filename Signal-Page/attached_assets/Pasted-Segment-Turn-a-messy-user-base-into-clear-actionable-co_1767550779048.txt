Segment: Turn a messy user base into clear, actionable cohorts
Right now your users all live in one big bucket.
I break them into real journeys you can act on: trial, onboarding, activated, dormant, churned.
You get behavior-based cohorts like:
“Activated but unpaid”: people who see the value but haven’t committed yet.


“At-risk high spenders”: customers you really don’t want to lose.


So you stop blasting everyone and start talking to the right users at the right moment.
Interpret: See what your users’ behavior is actually telling you
Instead of guessing why people drop off, we dig into product usage, engagement, and CRM data to:
Spot friction points where good users stall.


Flag behaviors that predict churn vs long-term value.


Define what “healthy” and “stuck” actually look like for your product.


Generate: Design flows that nudge users to the next meaningful action
Before a single email is written, we map the flow logic:
What triggers each message.


Who should enter or exit each sequence.


The exact path from “just signed up” to “paid and getting value.”


Whether it’s onboarding, activation, upsell, or reactivation, you get one clear conversion path instead of a random pile of emails.
Nurture: Build relationships, not just send sequences
Then we write the actual messages and the storyline that connects them:
A tone that sounds like you, not a template.


A cadence that feels helpful, not pushy.


Campaigns that educate, celebrate wins, and keep users moving.


The result: users feel guided, seen, and supported, not spammed.
Automate: Let the right messages fire at the right moment
We connect your behavioral events to your ESP, product, and CRM so messages go out when they matter:
Trial user didn’t hit activation? They get a targeted nudge.


Power user hit a usage milestone? They see an upgrade path.


Behind the scenes, we handle rules, triggers, data sync, and deliverability hygiene so you’re not babysitting automations.
Learn: Keep lifting retention instead of guessing in the dark
Once flows are live, we keep a tight feedback loop:
Track activation, retention, and expansion for each cohort.


Test new hypotheses on subject lines, offers, and triggers.


Feed what works back into your segmentation and copy.


You get a living lifecycle system that keeps getting better at turning users into revenue.
