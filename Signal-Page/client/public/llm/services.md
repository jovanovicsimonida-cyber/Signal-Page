# Signal — Services

## The Leak Audit

**One session. Full clarity.**

A 60-90 minute working session with your team — Product, Sales, and CS in the room.

**Investment:** $5,000 (one-time)
**Timeline:** Workshop + deliverable in 1-2 weeks

### Together, we define:

- The core jobs your users hire your product for
- The Aha moment for each job (in plain language and measurable events)
- The value path from signup to paid
- Where users stall and why

### What You Walk Away With:

- A documented JTBD + Aha map
- Stall points identified and prioritized
- A clear picture of what to build next

You'll know exactly what's broken, why it's breaking, and what to fix first.

You can take the deliverables and implement yourself. Or continue to the Build phase where SIGNAL + Reverb kick in.

## After the Audit

Once you know what's broken, you decide what happens next.

### Build

You get the full system designed. Your team implements it.

- Full SIGNAL + Reverb system designed
- Triggers, tags, segments, suppression logic
- All the email copy
- Reverb micro-cycles
- Measurement plan
- Everything documented — ready for your team to implement
- Ongoing support for A/B testing, iteration, and campaign strategy

### Build + Implement

Same as Build — but the system gets wired directly into your tools. You end up with a live, running system.

- Everything in Build, plus:
- System wired directly into your tools
- Tags created, segments built, triggers configured
- Emails loaded and live
- A running system, not just a spec
- Ongoing support for testing, optimization, and backend management

Pricing for Build and Build + Implement depends on your product, trial complexity, and tooling. We scope it after the Audit.
