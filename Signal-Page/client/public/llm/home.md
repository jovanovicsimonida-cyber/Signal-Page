# Signal — Homepage

## Your trial-to-paid flow finally does what it was supposed to do.

Users reach value. Upgrades happen. Your team stops guessing why some convert and most don't.

## The Problem

That's what it should look like, but in reality...

### The signups are there. The upgrades aren't.

You've built something good.
People sign up.
They poke around.
Some of them even start getting value.

And then... nothing.
Trial expires.
No upgrade.
**Gone.**

You're left staring at the dashboard wondering what went wrong.

Here's what's probably happening — **you're treating everyone the same.**

The user who connected their Stripe and imported real data gets the same Day 3 email as the one who logged in once and never came back.

One of them is ready to buy.
The other forgot you exist.
And you're talking to both of them the same way.

**That's the leak.**

## What your trial looks like when it actually converts

- A user completes step one but stalls on step two → They get a specific nudge.
- They hit their Aha moment → The sales pressure stops.
- They go dark → A recovery loop kicks in automatically.

No more blasting the same sequence to everyone.
No more guessing why trials don't convert.
No more rewriting onboarding every quarter hoping something sticks.

You get a system that knows where each user is, what they need next, and when to step in.

**That's what SIGNAL builds.**

## The SIGNAL Framework — Six stages from signup to paid

SIGNAL is the method behind the system.

1. **Segment** — Your users aren't one group. Stop emailing them like they are. Segmentation means knowing who's where, and building cohorts you can actually do something with.
2. **Interpret** — What are users telling you with their behavior? Which actions lead to upgrades? Where do good users get stuck? This stage turns raw event data into something you can use.
3. **Generate** — Design the flow before you write the words. What triggers the first email? What stops it from sending if they already upgraded? What happens if they stall on day four?
4. **Nurture** — Write like a human who wants them to succeed. Your emails finally sound like they came from a person who actually uses the product.
5. **Automate** — Set the rules so the system runs itself. Triggers, suppressions, cooldowns, "stop if paid" logic — handled.
6. **Learn** — Measure what matters and keep improving. Which cohorts convert best? Which nudges actually bring users back? What's worth testing next?

### REVERB Micro-Loops

The save that fires before the trial dies. SIGNAL builds the path. REVERB keeps users on it when they drift.

- **Trigger**: A stall signal fires — no key action taken, skipped step, repeated failure, drop in engagement.
- **Nudge**: The user gets the next step in plain language. No fluff.
- **Shortcut**: A template, example, quick-start guide, or "do this in 2 minutes" path reduces friction.
- **Escalation**: If they're still stuck — reply-to support, concierge assist, or a quick call. Only when needed.
- **Result**: Fewer silent trials. Faster time-to-value. More upgrades without discounts.

## If your trials leak, this is for you

You're running a SaaS or product-led company with a trial.
Users sign up.
Some convert.
Most don't.
You're not totally sure why.

Maybe you're post-Series A, trying to make revenue feel less random.
You've got a Day 1 / Day 3 / Day 7 drip running.
You don't know what's actually moving the needle.

Or maybe you're further along, post-Series E, plenty of tools, plenty of data, but the flows feel stitched together.
Product, Growth, and Lifecycle have different definitions of "activation."
You're improving things, but it's slow and noisy.

Either way, same problem: **users stall before they see value, and you don't have a system that catches them.**

If that sounds familiar, keep reading.
